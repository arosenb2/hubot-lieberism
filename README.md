## What is a Lieberism?
A Lieberism is the ultimate compliment one can receive. It originated from the credits of podcast [ReplyAll](http://replyall.limo) in reference to the co-founder of [Gimlet Media](http://gimletmedia.com/), [Matt Lieber](https://twitter.com/mlieber), and what a great job he does, such as "Matt Lieber keeps the lights on."
